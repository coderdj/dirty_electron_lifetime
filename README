Dirty electron lifetime

Seriously, don't use any of this for more than a basic example.

Included files:

make_waveform.py   : edit this with your mongodb collection and connection info to plot
		     things from the database.

extract_data.py	   : give it a mongo repo with raw data. It will extract peaks, give
		     them some (really rough!) basic properties and save them to a
		     pickle file.

matchpeaks.py	   : using the output from extract_data.py, put the peaks together to
		     form interactions in the most embarassingly simple way possible.
		     Plot things from interactions (or you can save to another file to
		     do that).


Have fun.
